<P>
There is a box of the shape of an 
<!-- MATH: $N \times N$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="525img1.gif"
 ALT="$N \times N$">
lattice. Each grid of the lattice may contain a milk bottle or
none. Mr. Smith wrote down the data of the box by making a record for each
row from left to right
and each column from top to bottom. In each record, `1' indicaes that there
is a bottle in the
corresponding grid and `0' does not. Unfortunately, the order of these
records is thrown into confusion, and some of these records have corrupted.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Now it's up to you to provide a program to recover these data:
i.e. to give the original arrangement of the box and give real values for
those corrupted data.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The input data is stored in the input file, where `2' denotes that the
corresponding character has
been corrupted. Each line in the file represents a record. You should output
the original
arrangement of the box, and show the record number for each column on the
top of the lattice, and
show the record number for each row to the left of the lattice.

<P>

<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
You are required to give only one possible result if there are many, and you
should give the 
indication `<TT>impossible</TT>' if there is no possibility of original arrangement.
